## Tuesday, 2017-12-05

Received plants from [LiveAquaria](http://www.liveaquaria.com). I ordered:
- 4 x Cryptocoryne spiralis: This were large, nice plants, think I received 5?
- 2 x Anubias nana: These are huge, too big for my tank. They will probably go to Donny.

I did *not* order but received 5 bunches of Myriophyllum pinnatum.

29g:
- added Vallisneria from 9g
